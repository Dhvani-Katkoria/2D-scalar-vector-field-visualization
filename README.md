# 2D-scalar-vector-field-visualization
2D scalar/vector field visualization for the data set of a simulation of a hurricane from the National Center for Atmospheric Research in the United States. 


The dataset is available at http://sciviscontest-staging.ieeevis.org/2004/data.html

The scalar fields are visualized using colour mapping, contour mapping, and height/elevation mapping, and vector field using the quiver/hedgehog plot.
For color mapping, visualization is done using 1-colour, 2-colour, 3-colour, and rainbow colour spectrum.
